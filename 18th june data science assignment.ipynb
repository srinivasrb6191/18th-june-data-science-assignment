    "5. What is logging in Python, and why is it important in software development?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Logging in Python is a module that allows developers to track events that occur while a program is running.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is crucial in software development for debugging, troubleshooting, and monitoring programs. By using logging, developers can record information about errors, warnings, and other events during program execution. Python's logging module provides fine-grained control over how log messages are handled, allowing developers to set levels to identify critical messages and filter them more flexibly.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Explain the purpose of log levels in Python logging and provide examples of when each log level would be appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: In Python logging, log levels indicate the severity of a log message, allowing developers to categorize and filter log entries based on their importance. Here are the common log levels in Python--\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTSET (0): The default level when a log is created, typically not used explicitly. The root logger is usually created with level WARNING.\n",
    "\n",
    "DEBUG (10): Used for detailed information useful for debugging purposes, providing insights into the program's internal state or flow. For example, detailed variable values during program execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "INFO (20): Confirms that things are working as expected, providing general information about the program's operation. Suitable for confirming successful operations or milestones reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "WARNING (30): Indicates something unexpected happened or a potential problem in the near future. Useful for highlighting issues that may need attention but do not prevent the program from running.\n",
    "\n",
    "ERROR (40): Signifies a more serious problem where the software was unable to perform a function due to an error. Used to report errors that impact the program's functionality but do not stop it entirely.\n",
    "\n",
    "CRITICAL (50): Indicates a severe error that prevents the program from continuing to run. Used for critical errors that require immediate attention as they can lead to program failure.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. What are log formatters in Python logging, and how can you customise the log message format using formatters?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: In Python logging, log formatters are objects responsible for defining the layout and structure of log messages. They allow developers to customize the format of log messages, including the timestamp, log level, message content, and additional contextual information.\n",

    "###### 8. How can you set up logging to capture log messages from multiple modules or classes in a Python application?\n",
    "Ans: In Python, you can set up logging to capture log messages from multiple modules or classes by following these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a Logger: First, create a logger object using the logging.getLogger() function. Give the logger a unique name to distinguish it from other loggers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Configure Logging Level: Set the logging level for the logger using the setLevel() method. This controls which log messages are captured by the logger based on their severity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Create Log Handlers: Create one or more log handlers to define where log messages should be sent. Handlers can send log messages to different destinations such as the console, files, or network streams.\n",
    "\n",
    "Configure Logging Format: Optionally, configure a log formatter to customize the format of log messages. This allows you to specify the layout and content of log messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Add Handlers to Logger: Add the log handlers to the logger using the addHandler() method. This associates the handlers with the logger, allowing them to capture log messages generated by the logger.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the Logger: In your modules or classes, use the logger object to generate log messages using methods such as debug(), info(), warning(), error(), and critical(). These methods will send log messages to all the handlers associated with the logger.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. What is the difference between the logging and print statements in Python? When should you use logging over print statements in a real-world application?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: In Python, both logging and print statements serve the purpose of displaying information, but they have distinct functionalities and are used for different purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Logging is a technique to display useful messages and warnings to users, providing a flexible way to log messages in various output destinations like the console, files, and networks. other hand, the print statement is a built-in function mainly used for debugging and displaying values to the console.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Logging offers log levels (Debug, Info, Error, Warning, Critical), filtering, formatting, and more. Print statements does not have log levels; it simply prints whatever is passed to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Logging is recommended for production code due to its features like log levels and filtering. Other hand, commonly used for quick debugging or displaying simple information during development.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Write a Python program that logs a message to a file named \"app.log\" with the following requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "● The log message should be \"Hello, World!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "● The log level should be set to \"INFO.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "● The log file should append new log entries without overwriting previous ones."
